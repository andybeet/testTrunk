README

Please follow the instructions on the Atlantis wiki regarding how to compile and run Atlantis. 

These examples files are provided to allow you to make sure you have successfully compiled Atlantis and it will run on your system. 
You should not attempt to develop an Atlantis model in isolation. 
Considerable discussion and advice from Beth Fulton and the wider Atlantis community is required to successfully develop an Atlantis model. 




Base test files:

atlantis -i INIT_VMPA_Jan2015.nc 0 -o outputSETAS.nc -r VMPA_setas_run_fishing_F_Trunk.prm -f VMPA_setas_force_fish_Trunk.prm -p VMPA_setas_physics.prm -b VMPA_setas_biol_fishing_Trunk.prm -h VMPA_setas_harvest_F_Trunk.prm  -s SETasGroupsDem.csv -q SETasFisheries.csv -d OutputFolderTest

On Windows you should be able to use the runsetasNew.bat to run the model after you have sucessfully compiled the executable.

On Linux the runTrunk is a good place to start but will require some editing before it will run.
