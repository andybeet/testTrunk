/**
 *	\brief Reads a list of time series of economic statistics (e.g. GDP) from an ascii file.
 *	The time series are specified as shown below.
 *	econtsnn means ts followed by the integer box number time series is in nn
 *  (with the minimum number of digits needed).
 *  Here, S is a string (which must not contain whitespace),
 *  N is an integer and X, Y, Z and A are floating point
 *  numbers.
 *
 *  This routine depends on the existence of a global variable:
 *  verbose -   Sets level of messages printed
 *
\begin{verbatim
# Parameters for each fisheries time series
# Point source/sink name
econtsnn.name    S

# Location ( x y )
econtsnn.location X Y

# Data - the next line is a time series definition
# as used by my timeseries routines in sjwlib. The example
# below assumes that the data is in an ascii or netCDF file.
econtsnn.data  filename
\end{verbatim}
  *
  * Input variables and parameters:
  * name:		Name of ascii file containing list of fisheries time series
  * tsname:		Name of times series (catch or effort) being read
  * t_units:	Time units to be used for time series
  * econts:		Returned pointer to fisheries time series list
